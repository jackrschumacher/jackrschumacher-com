**Last Updated: February 21, 2026**

This privacy policy outlines how information is collected and used on jackrschumacher.com. Because this is a personal, static website, data collection is kept to an absolute minimum.

### 1. Information Collection and Use

#### Website Hosting and Server Logs

This site is a static website built with Hugo and hosted on Cloudflare. Like most standard website hosting environments, Cloudflare automatically collects basic, non-personally identifying information that web browsers and servers typically make available. This includes:

* Browser type
* Language preference
* Referring site
* The date and time of each visitor request
* IP addresses (used primarily for security and preventing malicious attacks)

This data is used solely for maintaining the security, performance, and reliability of the website. It is not used to identify individual visitors.

#### Contact Information

If you choose to reach out via the provided contact methods on the [Contact](/contact) page, any information you provide (such as your name, email address, and the contents of your message) will only be used to respond to your inquiry. Your information will never be sold, rented, or added to marketing mailing lists.

### 2. Cookies and Tracking

This static website does not use tracking cookies, targeted advertising pixels, or invasive third-party analytics scripts to track your browsing behavior across the web. 

### 3. Third-Party Services

The infrastructure of this site relies on Cloudflare for hosting, DNS resolution, and security (DDoS protection). Cloudflare may process network traffic data to provide these services. You can review [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for more details on how they handle infrastructure data.

### 4. Links to External Sites

This website contains links to external sites, including GitHub repositories and other personal projects. Please be aware that I am not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these other sites. I encourage you to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.
